# StyleTransfer-GAN-Personalized-Fashion-Outfit-Generator
## Objective:
Design a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that creates fashion outfit suggestions tailored to a user’s preferences, using a combination of style transfer and GANs to generate new clothing images from text or reference images.

## Problem Statement:
Modern fashion recommendation systems lack creativity and often just retrieve similar items from a database. The goal of this project is to generate entirely new outfit pieces (like shirts, dresses, shoes) in the user’s preferred style using GANs.
